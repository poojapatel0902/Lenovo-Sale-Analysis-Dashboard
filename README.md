## Project Insights
1. Revenue Growth
Lenovo’s revenue shows a steady upward trend with strong growth after FY2020/21, indicating increasing market demand and expansion.
2. Performance & Profitability
Profitability improved significantly around FY2021/22, reflecting better cost control and operational efficiency.
Temporary dips in later years suggest market pressure or rising costs.
3. Operational Efficiency
Efficiency charts show that while revenue increased, costs also rose, impacting margins in certain years.
Peak efficiency was observed during high-revenue years with controlled expenses.
4. Operating Leverage
Higher operating profit at increased revenue levels indicates positive operating leverage, meaning fixed costs were effectively absorbed as sales grew.
5. Shareholder Value
EPS increased sharply until FY2021/22, showing strong returns to shareholders.
A decline in FY2023/24 followed by recovery suggests short-term challenges but long-term stability.
6. Cost Distribution
The “Where did the money go?” chart highlights that operational and other costs consume a significant portion of revenue, emphasizing the importance of expense optimization.

## Conclusion
The Lenovo Laptop Sales Analysis project demonstrates that Lenovo has experienced overall growth in revenue and profitability over the analyzed period. Despite fluctuations caused by rising costs and market challenges, the company shows strong recovery capability, efficient operating leverage, and consistent value creation for shareholders.
This dashboard provides valuable insights for business strategy, financial planning, and cost optimization, making it a useful decision-support tool for stakeholders and management.
